<h1>Data Structure</h1>
<p>Memory, booleans, integer, floating point, arrays(why index start from 0), dynamic arrays(javascript/ruby)</p>
<p>Linked Lists - a sequence of data nodes, each contains data fields and a pointer to next node. Searching in linked list is very expensive. 
Doubly Linked Lists - store one more pointer
